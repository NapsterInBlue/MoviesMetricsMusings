## There

<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->

When I left my job in May, I'd never even heard of Andrew Yang. Like most of the people I'd come to meet at the tail end of last year, I'd never really bothered with politics, neither.

I'll spare you my waxing poetic about how I'd spent my summer travelling, leaning into hobbies, and studing like mad. By the time autumn rolled around, I was finally figuring out how to like myself without citing my last performance review as evidence. So go figure the guy telling the world "we need to stop confusing human value with economic value" struck a real chord with me.

I was surprised and humbled that the campaign reached out to me. Endeared as all hell when "I'm just trying to build cool stuff with my friends" is one of the best interview answers they'd heard. I'd been saying that for years. They extended an offer and I'd never felt such a draw to go be a part of something in my life. It wasn't even an option.

In the span of about a week and a half, I had broken my lease, packed the majority of my stuff into storage, loaded the rest into my car, and took my first adventure away from Michigan and into the great unknown (Read: Rural Iowa).

The next few months were the hardest I've ever worked. Moreover, the most I'd ever let myself believe in something. I still can't make out if it felt like an eternity or happened in a flash. But I can say for certain that then it was over as soon as it had started.

## And Back Again

Along the way, it occurred to me that I'd want to remember the experience. And so I took a lot of screenshots.

And a whole mess of pictures. Some flattering.

Some not so much.

<center>Sorry guys, lol</center>
<br></br>

But it never possessed me that "I could get tens of blog hits about this!" Frankly, I was too busy to document my time in Iowa up and down. Combing my computer the last few days, I've just got what I've got-- all of the data, emails, and Slack correspondance are gone for good.

And that's certainly for the better, I'm not interested in writing a salty tell-all. Frankly, I'd be A-OK if this proves to be too boring for some hack journalist to rip off for ad revenue. Nor do I want to go running roughshod over the NDAs I've signed (the boilerplate kind, not the hush hush kind).

Whether or not anyone decides that this is worth reading, I intend for this to be more self-care than anything else. For the most part, I'm past the depression of it all. But I've been... stuck these last couple of weeks. This is my attempt at closing the slew of mental tabs I haven't been able to drop.
